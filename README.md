### DTR

For this project, we decided to make sure that throughout the project, we both felt like we understood completely what was going on. Therefore, we chose to mostly work together.

Our learning goals were:
- Learn more about Rails
- Feel more confident with the MVC structure of the app
- Making sure we were using TDD
- Get more comfortable with CSS

We had very similar collaboration styles, we both like to mostly do paired programming and break out for a while if we're stuck on something, so that we can each explore different paths.

Some of the rules we established were:
-Always communicate openly
-To not trail ahead, to avoid hurting the other one's learning process
-Do not merge your own PR

When we ran into issues, we mostly asked for help after struggling for a while. We asked upper mod students, our peers and the instructors.

We used Waffle to keep track of our progress, Slack for communication, Skedda to book rooms to pair and Github to review each other's PRs.
